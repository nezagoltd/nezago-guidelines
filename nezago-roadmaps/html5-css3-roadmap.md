## Introduction
Any Career needs a starting point, web development do so. 100 % of websites have HTML and CSS on their design. That is why
if you need to become a good web developer you should have a better understanding of HTML and CSS. At Nezago, we believe that
if you master theory, and much of practices, you can change the world. The following is the roadmap of HTML and CSS that we
believe them to take you from zero experience to working experience. 

We believe in giving you clear roadmaps, because whenever you need to learn new skills and the sea of resources out there, i that case you need a guide.

### Courses to take
1. The very first lesson we recommend you to go with is [Web Development](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101?ref=lnav)

#### Course overview
This is where it all begins! A hands-on introduction to all of the essential tools you'll need to build real, working websites. You'll learn what web developers actually do – the foundations you'll need for later courses.

__Note:__ 

i. If you are going to follow this lesson, from **nezago** training program, you should make sure that any project you will do during this project, get approved by a *Neza Software Support Engineer* (**NSSE**) before continuing.

ii. Make sure that all projects listed in this course you work on them and submit them on **The odin project contribution page**. Once you are done with this course, and all projects are done, you should go to the next lesson.

2. Continue with [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css?ref=lnav) complete course from **The Odin Project**

#### Course overview
In this course, you’ll learn HTML5 and CSS3, the foundations of building and styling modern web pages. We’ll also dip into design and UX because it’s difficult to call yourself a full stack developer without having at least a cursory appreciation for the decisions that produce the page itself. If you’re taking this course because you want to build your own websites, that section will be even more helpful.
